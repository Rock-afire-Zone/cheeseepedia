Created and posted by Aaron Fechter, and Choreographed by Hunter using Retromation. 

The Video was an advertisement for both the new simulated 'Billybob Show' along side the Advent Calendars. The Billybob show made its debut in a controversial way using the lyrics "So get smarted, not (r-slur)", which was later changed due to back lash to "So get smarted, not restarted" which remained for every other use of this intro.
Afterwards Billybob and Looney Bird would talk about the Advent Calendars and whats included with it. 
Later on Looney Bird would talk about how Aaron would be throwing in free brochures with each purchase, to where Rolfe would interupt being greedy as usual before being absolutely berated by Earl
